            <p class="text-white-50">
                At PrintPoint we work with our clients to make sure that they're heard and understood while creating a product that truly personal to our client's brand. We make sure our clients don't simply place orders with a predefined design, material, and/or dimensions if they don't want to, rather we offer our clients a consultative service that helps them discuss ideas, and share the concept of their ideal packaging that best represents their brand before they place an order. Our team believes in delivering not only a product, but a service that helps our clients grow their business by helping them grow and maintain happy customers. 
                "Our mission is to never let you have a gap in the value you deliver to your customers. We want to help you close the gaps and showcase your product in a way that your customers fall in love with your product from the time they lay their eyes on it, whether when its sitting on the shelf, displayed online, or when the customer first receives their delivery sitting at home." M. Tariq Sheikh, CEO at PrintPoint

                Our Journey
                With over 45 years of experience throughout Middle East, Asia, Europe and US, our CEO M. Tariq Sheikh has gathered a great sum of knowledge, experience and partnerships with key players in the market to create a product that meets... ?
                Tariq begun at an early age in the 1970s with a passion for printing and determination to create a product that stands out while keeping at a reasonable price for the customer.
                He initially worked with machinery specific to block print, until he found a way to work with standard machinery to create results that a UV machine would. His journey with learning machines over the years has given him an upper hand to work not only as a business man, but an all rounded machine expert to create results from a basic machine that you wouldn't see in the market. His expertise has grown in developing effects using various machines that are hard to achive. 
                Today, Tariq creates products that reach to customers globally at the end of the supply chain. Going online has never made more sense.
